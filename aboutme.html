<h1 style="color:#ff6666;"> About Me</h1>


<p style="line-height: 30px;" >  I come from a family that has heard nothing but ¨pardon me,¨with a tone of sarcasm in their voice. Heard nothing but apologies. I came to be brought in a place where at five years old I came face to face to discrimination. My preschool teacher asked me to wash myself better, rub the dirty skin of mines. In efforts to expunge my dark skin. In efforts to erase my dignity. Erase my pride of being of being a brown girl.  And at five years old, it did get to me. It went to the point where I was uncomfortable with my skin. Eventually I somehow let my parents know and they took action immediately. But yet the only thing they could get from that teacher was an apology. Apologizing from believing that my dark, brown skin was dirty. 
	Apologies are all we got. There wasn´t a time where they mistaken me from being the child my mother took care of. It was caused by our differences in skin color. No one should feel ashamed of their skin. No one should have that power to discriminate someone because they don’t think that person has the right skin color. Yet we can’t deny that the lighter the skin, the whiter, the more privileges.  By a simple glance at your skin, it’s where they determine whether you are trustworthy or not. 
	If I wasn´t clear enough, I am biased against racism. I am biased against discrimination. I am biased against white privilege, the creators of the American Dream. I am biased against those who feel superior and empowered over those who are oppressed. 
	I come from a family that has been wrongfully labeled and stereotyped every chance they got. In order to prevent stereotypes as much as they could, they developed a skill. They became aware to keep as least interaction with the police as possible. We all know where the story ends when the police are put to call with people of color. They know to stay neutral and no to react to racist comments, unless it comes down to their kids, they must take action. They know what it is like to be a colored person in a placed dominance of the whites. 
	I stand along with those who are oppressed. I stand along with those who are stereotyped. I will not let them label me. I will not let their racist comments get to me. That helpless, impotent five year old self is long gone.</p>
